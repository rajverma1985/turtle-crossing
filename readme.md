Step 1 - Check out how the game play works

1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key.
It can only move forwards, not back, left or right. -- DONE!

2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the
right edge of the screen to the left edge. -- DONE!

3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original
position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases. -- DONE!

4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops. -- DONE
5. Do the scoring and game over logic
